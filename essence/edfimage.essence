$ Size of the group this group is a subgroup of

$ Size of each set

$ Inverse of group
given inverses: matrix indexed by [int(1..n)] of int(1..n)

$ Multiplication table, as table and tuples
given multable: matrix indexed by [int(1..n), int(1..n)] of int(1..n)
given multuples: matrix indexed by [int(1..n*n), int(1..3)] of int(1..n)

$ x*y^-1, as table and tuples

$ The EDF, expressed as a list of lists
find edf: matrix indexed by [int(1..setnum), int(1..setsize)] of int(1..n)
$ A second representation of the EDF, where each set is represented as
$ a boolean array (so [2,3,6] is represented as [F,T,T,F,F,T] for example)
$ find boolrep: matrix indexed by [int(1..setnum), int(1..s)] of bool


$ Extra variables, to represent the values of x*y^-1, for every pairing
find edfmap: matrix indexed by [int(1..setnum), int(1..setsize), int(1..setnum), int(1..setsize)] of int(1..n)

such that

$ Require that edf and boolrep represent the same EDF

$ No value is repreated in any set of the EDF
$ allDiff(flatten(edf)),

$ $ Use the symmetry breaking (you can ask what this means)
$ $ Basically, we are saying that if we apply any symmetry to any set in the EDF,
$ $ the result should not be lexicographically smaller than the smallest set in the EDF.

forAll i : int(1..setnum). forAll j : int(1..setsize-1). edf[i,j] <= edf[i,j+1],

$ order the sets in the EDF by first value, to break symmetry on the outer list
forAll i : int(1..setnum-1). edf[i,1] <= edf[i+1,1],


$ Now set up the 'edfmap', this makes a variable 'edfmap[p1,p2,q1,q2]'
$ which is equal to x*y^-1, where x is the p2th element of the p1st set
